File input:
    ReadTVData - From readFile.pdf on the course website
    Takes in the database file and stores it in a tree from showTree.h
        In: TV show database file name
        Out: Creates a binary search tree and reads the TV shows + information into nodes of the tree

String Routines
    removeBlanksFromString
        loop through characters of string, replacing spaces with the nul \0 character
    IndexOf
        loop through each character of the array, comparing it to an input character
    GetSubString
        loop through the characters of an array from a given starting index to ending index, copying each character to a second array. Return the second array
